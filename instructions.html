<p>If you are an author of a paper that appeared in the Fifth
International
Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, then you are
invited to create/update abstract information for your paper
as it appears in the Workshop proceedings and/or the subsequent
Springer Verlag collection. I (Doug Fisher) will try to create
a few abstract pages for Workshop papers not currently online
each week. However, if you wish to speed the inclusion of your
paper, then (1) copy a sample abstract that is currently
online, (2) replace the title, author, abstract, related
publication material with the corresponding material from your
own paper, and mail me the result. Please do not otherwise change the 
formatting (but of course if you have suggestions along these lines
then let me know.)</p>

<p>
I also invite authors to update their abstract pages at any time
with related publications. To do so, simply copy your page,
append related publication references (references ONLY!)
to the end, and mail me the
result. Try to adhere to the reference format that I have established
(approximately APA) as closely as possible.</p>

<p>
Finally, feel free to insert URL links into any of your material,
by copying, modifying, and returning.</p>
